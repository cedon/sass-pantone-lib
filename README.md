# Pantone-SASS-Lib

A library for taking Pantone color names and converting them in various values. Users enter in a color name, such as "Pantone-Violet-c" and the function will return the correct value for the color. 

This library uses SASS Maps for the conversion and requires [SASS 3.3](https://github.com/sass/sass/blob/master/doc-src/SASS_CHANGELOG.md#330-7-march-2014) or higher.
